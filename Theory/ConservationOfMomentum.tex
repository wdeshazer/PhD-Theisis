\subsection{Conservation of Momentum} \label{sub:MomentumConservation}

A very important aspect of the equations utilized for this research is that the momentum conservation recovers the fundamental electromagnetic principle inherent in the Lorentz \vxb forces, which are orthogonal to the direction of motion. 
%
\begin{equation}
	\vec{F} = e(\vec{E} + \vxb)
	\label{eqn:Lorentz}
\end{equation}
%
For this reason the bulk fluid toroidal, $V_\varphi$, and poloidal $V_\theta$ velocities influence the radial momentum conservation in \cref{subsub:MCRadial} and the poloidal in \cref{subsub:MCPoloidal}. Additionally, because there is a radial particle flux outward, $\Gamma_{rj},\Gamma_{rk}$, there is a radial electric field that manifests.
