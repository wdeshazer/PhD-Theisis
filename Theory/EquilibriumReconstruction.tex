\subsubsection{Equilibrium Reconstruction} \label{subsub:EFIT}
A primary input into the \ac{IOL} model is the flux surface $\psi$ (see \cref{eqn:IOLMinV0}). $\psi$ is a parameter that quantifies the amount of enclosed magnetic field. One issue that must determined is the magnetic field topology, both shape and location, which is referred to as MHD equilibrium reconstruction. It is based on solving the Grad-Shafronov equations (\cref{eqn:GradShafDeltaStar} and \cref{eqn:GradShafCurrentDensity}). The work horse tool that performs this reconstruction is EFIT \cite{Lao1990}. It balances the magnetic field forces with toroidal current density, i.e. plasma pressure and Lorentz forces due to poloidal field currents. For this research, the flux surfaces from the MHD reconstruction will be considered as defined.

\begin{equation}
	\Delta \ast \left(\psi\right) = \mu_0 R J_T
	\label{eqn:GradShafDeltaStar}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	J_T = R \left[ P'\left(\psi; \alpha_n\right) + \cfrac{\mu_0 FF' \left(\psi; \gamma_n \right)}{4 \pi^2 R^2}\right]
	\label{eqn:GradShafCurrentDensity}
\end{equation}
