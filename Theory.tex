\section{Theory} \label{sec:Theory}

The fundamental parts of the predictive model are the conservation of particles (\cref{sub:ParticleConservation}), momentum (\cref{sub:MomentumConservation}), and energy (\cref{sub:EnergyConservation}), the conduction closure (\cref{sub:ConductionClosure}) and the ideal gas law (\cref{sub:IdealGasLaw}). Within each of the conservation equations there is provision for the removal of particles, momentum, and energy due to \ac{IOL}, which is described in \cref{sub:IOL}. \ac{IOL} calculation requires input from the equilibrium reconstruction. Therefore, a short overview is provided in \cref{subsub:EFIT}.  The primary source of particles, momentum, and energy considered is beam input and therefore, details on the beam modeling are covered in \cref{sub:BeamModeling}. Finally, the pinch diffusion model is described, because there is a desire to recast the conservation equations in the form of a pinch diffusion equation. Therefore, the pinch diffusion model will be discussed in \cref{sub:PinchDiffusion}

\subsection{Ideal Gas Law}\label{sub:IdealGasLaw}

The relationship between the pressure calculated in the momentum equation and the density that initializes the iteration, there is an implied temperature which is given by the ideal gas law
\begin{equation}
	P = n\, T
	\label{eqn:IdealGasLaw}
\end{equation}
Based on the iteration strategy chosen (\cref{sec:ComputationalModeling}), this temperature must align with the temperature implied by conservation of energy.
