\subsubsection{Equilibrium Reconstruction} \label{subsub:EFIT}
- Magnetic Field Topology Reconstruction done through EFIT
- Philosophy - described in \cite{Lao1990}
- MHD Equilibrium constraint
- Balance magnetic field forces with toroidal current density, i.e. plasma pressure and Lorentz forces due to poloidal field currents.
- Assumptions:
-Zero Rotation
-internal poloidal magnetic field measurements
-Spectroscopy and Faraday rotation (This utilizes the polarization light emitted in the plasma, which must be along the field lines. This establishes $\frac{B_\phi}{B}$)

-The kinetic information from EFIT is replaced with the physics developed in the current research.

\begin{equation}
	\Delta \ast \left(\psi\right) = \mu_0 R J_T
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	J_T = R \left[ P'\left(\psi; \alpha_n\right) + \cfrac{\mu_0 FF' \left(\psi; \gamma_n \right)}{4 \pi^2 R^2}\right]
\end{equation}
