\newglossaryentry{SOL}{
	name={SOL},
	description={A region outside of the \ac{LCFS} that serves as the exhaust for tokamak plasmas. It derives its name from the early tokamak designs that put a physical barrier known as a limiter in the region to "scrape" off the outer layer of the plasma. The limiter design has mostly been replaced with the divertor design but this plasma region retains the same designation.}
